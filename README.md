Folder structure:
- send_Tx.py: Python script to interact with the board (i.e., send Nonce, receive raw transactions generated by the board and reply with ack);
- code: folder with the ARM microcontroller code. The code produces new raw transactions with increasing nonce, delivers them to the connected PC and waits for the ack.

To simulate the transactions generation and transmission, be sure that:
- the board is connected to the computer;
- in file transactions.c, instruction 17, Rop_privK must be replaced with your secret key; 
- in file send_Tx.py, be sure that the serial port is correctly set. Also, you must insert the sender address (i.e., the one corresponding to the secret written in transactions.c).
